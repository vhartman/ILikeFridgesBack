Receipt preprocessing procedure:
- Scale image down
- Convert to BW
- Rotate for horizontal/vertical alignment
- Crop to only receipt
- Reduce to 1D image: results in a barcode-like-thing after thresholding
- Crop around the bars in a certain size (certain fontsize), and put through OCR
- - gives back one line of text
- - must contain word (product)/number (price) pair
- - look at first word to identify if it goes in the fridge
